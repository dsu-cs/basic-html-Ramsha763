                The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a way to explain how data travels from one device to another over a network. It is divided into seven layers, and each layer has a specific job in sending and receiving information. These layers help organize how software, hardware, and networking systems work together to make communication possible. By using the OSI model, network engineers can better understand, design, and fix problems in networks because they know exactly which layer is responsible for each part of the communication process.
