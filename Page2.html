            <p>The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) model is the main set of rules that allows computers to communicate over the internet. It controls how data is broken into packets, sent across networks, and then put back together when it reaches the correct device. TCP ensures that the data arrives safely and in the correct order, while IP is responsible for finding the destination address and routing the data to the right place. Together, TCP/IP makes it possible for emails, websites, and online messages to travel quickly and reliably between devices around the world.</p>
